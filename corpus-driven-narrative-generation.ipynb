    "# A few simple corpus-driven approaches to narrative analysis and generation\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a fast introduction to a few techniques for working with narrative corpora. By \"narrative corpora,\" I mean pre-existing bodies of text that mostly contain the texts of narratives. In particular, we're going to use Mark Riedl's [WikiPlots corpus](https://github.com/markriedl/WikiPlots), which has the titles and plot summaries of more than one hundred thousand movies, books, television shows and other media from Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook takes you through using [spaCy](http://spacy.io) to extract words, noun chunks, parts of speech and entities from the text and then sew them back together with [Tracery](http://tracery.io). It then shows how to use [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) to create new narratives from existing narrative text, along with a quick example of recurrent neural network text generation with [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python, but you don't really need to know Python in order to use the notebook. Everything's pre-written for you, so you can just execute the cells, making small changes to the code as needed. Even if the notebook itself doesn't end up being useful to you, hopefully it spurs a few ideas that you can take with you into your practice as a storyteller and/or programmer."

    "The first step is to get the narrative corpus into the program. Because WikiPlots is so big, we're actually going to be working with a smaller subset: only the plot summaries for romantic comedy movies. The subcorpus was made using [this notebook on creating a subcorpus of WikiPlots](creating-a-wikiplots-subcorpus.ipynb), which you can consult if you want to make your own with a different subset of WikiPlots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus we're working with takes the form of a TSV file (\"tab separated values\"), with each line containing the title of the movie, a number indicating where in the plot summary the sentence for this line occurs, the total number of sentences in the summary, and the actual text of the sentence.

Markov chain text generation has been a pastime of poets and programmers going back [all the way to 1983](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24969024), so it should be no surprise that there are many implementations of the idea in Python that you can download and install. The one we're going to use is [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), a Markov chain text generation library originally developed for BuzzFeed, apparently. Writing [code to implement a Markov chain generator](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/ngrams-and-markov-chains.ipynb) on your own is certainly possible, but Markovify comes with a lot of extra niceties that will make our lives easier."

    "## Neural network text prediction with `textgenrnn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a [Markov chain](ngrams-and-markov-chains.ipynb), a recurrent neural network (RNN) is a way to make predictions about what will come next in a sequence. For our purposes, the sequence in question is a sequence of characters, and the prediction we want to make is *which character will come next*. Both Markov models and recurrent neural networks do this by using statistical properties of text to make a *probability distribution* for what character will come next, given some information about what comes before. The two procedures work very differently internally, and we're not going to go into the gory details about implementation here. (But if you're interested in the gory details, [here's a good place to start](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).) For our purposes, the main *functional* difference between a Markov chain and a recurrent neural network is the *portion* of the sequence used to make the prediction. A Markov model uses a fixed window of history from the sequence, while an RNN (theoretically) uses the *entire history* of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit of an RNN over a Markov model for text generation is that an RNN takes into account *the entire history* of a sequence when generating the next character. This means that, for example, an RNN can theoretically learn how to close quotes and parentheses, which a Markov chain will never be able to reliably do (at least for pairs of quotes and parentheses longer than the n-gram of the Markov chain).\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback of RNNs is that they are *computationally expensive*, from both a processing and memory perspective. This is (again) a simplification, but internally, RNNs work by \"squishing\" information about the training data down into large matrices, and make predictions by performing calculations on these large matrices. That means that you need a lot of CPU and RAM to train an RNN, and the resulting models (when stored to disk) can be very large. Training an RNN also (usually) takes a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration is the size of your corpus. Markov models will give interesting and useful results even for very small datasets, but RNNs require large amounts of data to train—the more data the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do you do if you *don't* have a very large corpus? Or if you don't have a lot of time to train on your corpus?\n",
    "\n",
    "### RNN generation from pre-trained models\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, developer and data scientist [Max Woolf](https://github.com/minimaxir) has made a Python library called [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn) that makes it really easy to experiment with RNN text generation. This library includes a model (according to the documentation) \"trained on hundreds of thousands of text documents, from Reddit submissions (via BigQuery) and Facebook Pages (via my Facebook Page Post Scraper), from a very diverse variety of subreddits/Pages,\" and allows you to use this model as a starting point for your own training."
